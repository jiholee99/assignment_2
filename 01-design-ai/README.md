# Designing your Complex Info Processing System (_AI_)

Let's think through existing AI systems using the Benjamin chapter & Simon chapter and get a _back of the napkin_ sketch of a reimagined system
<br /><br />

1. Name a real-world example of an existing AI system that is problematic in that it actually enacts existing problematic social systems/practices
2. Describe this system in terms of (your perceived high-level) **goals**, **environment**, and **adaptations** of the system.
3. Describe a potential reimagined system in terms of **goals**, **environment**, and **adaptations**. How does it improve upon the system described in 2?

<br /><br />
This is meant to allow us to begin to bridge from designing independent of implementation, to designing along side implementation. This is also meant to have us think about how our AI systems are developed within existing social contexts.

Remember, you can draw pictures/diagrams to augment your words (for the **G**, **E**, and **A**).

### Goals

+ What might be the goals of the _AI_ system?

### Environment

+ What is the environment that the system will be adapting within?

<div style="margin-bottom: 265px;">&nbsp;</div>

### Adaptation

+ How might the system adapt to the environment given the goals? How might it's inner environment change?

## Instructions
- Create a new markdown file called `design-AI.md` within this directory
- Fill in your answers to 1, 2, and 3 within the markdown. Make sure to keep it organized and to remember you can use media, links, etc. as you will
 - For organization, start each answer with this format - `# 1. _Name a real-world example of an existing AI system that is problematic in that it actually enacts existing problematic social systems/practices_`, `#2. _Describe this system in terms of (your perceived high-level) **goals**, **environment**, and **adaptations** of the system._`, etc.
- Submit your `design-AI.md` file to the submission link on Canvas.
