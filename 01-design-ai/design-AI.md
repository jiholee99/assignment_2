# 1. _Name a real-world example of an existing AI system that is problematic in that it actually enacts existing problematic social systems/practices_

A problematic algorithm that reinforces existing social issues is Facebook's utilization of A.I. to increase user engagement on their platforms. While the algorithm's intention is not to endorse violence or bad behavior, it frequently gives rise to unintended consequences that adversely impact numerous users. For instance, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread dissemination of false information on Facebook caused significant concern, as the inherently inaccurate news had the potential to lead individuals misinformed, fostering harmful beliefs such as racial bias against Asian individuals.

# 2. _Describe this system in terms of (your perceived high-level) **goals**,**environment**, and **adaptations** of the system._

**Goals**    
    The goal of the Facebook's AI system is to attract as many people as possible to use the Facebook App so that they would create more profit and provide user a news that they are interested in.    
**Environment**      
    The environment in which Facebook's AI system is in is a complex and dynamic one. There is a wide variety of users and contents, and these are constantly interacting and affecting each other. Users interact with each other by liking, commenting, and sharing posts. They can also create their own posts, which can be news articles, photos, videos, or anything else.         
**Adaptations**     
    The Facebook AI system adapts to its environment by analyzing millions of user data and behavioral patterns to learn what each user likes and the preferences of the masses. It then recommends posts or news that would satisfy most of the users on its apps. The inner environment of the system changes as the system gathers more information and makes changes to its algorithms. As the system makes changes, it could reinforce certain types of content and can cause some unintended consequences.
